Fraud Detection Project

Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions in financial data using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains millions of transactions, and the model helps identify potential frauds to prevent financial losses.

Features
-Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and handling missing values
-Feature Engineering: Selecting important features for better accuracy
-Model Training: Using machine learning (Random Forest) to detect fraud
-Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Technologies Used
-Python 
-Pandas
-NumPy
-Scikit-Learn
-Jupyter Notebook
